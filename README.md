 * the script `data_loggers/hobo_data/field/temp_light.R` processes the temperature and light from feb-june 2019 in uv-filtering and uv-transmitting windows 

 * the script `data_loggers/ibutton_data/field/windows-ibuttons.R` processses the 2- and 3-day temperature and relative humidity from uv-filtering windows, uv-transmitting windows, and site reference microsites. 

 * the script `data_loggers/light_quality.R` processes the point measurements of PAR and UV-A/B under uv-filtering windows, uv-transmitting windows, and site reference microsites. 

 * the script `pigments_tocopherols/pigments_t-test.R` processes pigments and tocopherol data for all field treatments and lab cultures. 
 
  * the script `fluorescence/fluorescence.R` processes a subset of the full fluorescence data (only Fv/Fm, Fo, Fm, and PHI PSII) from field and lab experiments.
